## Features

- **Real-time Streaming:** Leverages Server-Sent Events (SSE) to deliver responses in manageable chunks.
- **Claude API Integration:** Uses the Claude API for advanced natural language processing.
- **React Ready:** Designed to work seamlessly with React for dynamic UI updates.
- **Modular and Scalable:** Clean codebase that is easy to maintain and extend.
